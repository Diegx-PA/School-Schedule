# School Schedule
 A python program I made to keep up with my online school clases
 Fell free to use this program to keep up with your classes,
 for now it works with google meets, i haven't tested other software yet

 to update the schedule you can go to Classes_today.py and change modify the dictionaries
 once you have modified it open the folder on cmd and use the command 'class -h' to start

to modify the timing go to Classes_today.py and modify the array timings inside the function 'find_classes()'
you will notice that saturday and sunday are commented out you can re-enable them if you need them

inside Class.py i commented out a line of code that prints motivational quotes every time you call 'class -t'

Fell free to use it and share it and if you like it give it stars on github
